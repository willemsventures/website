                            <p>We prefer to have a video-call with the potential investor and make sure that we are

                                <br>After negotiating the terms, a shareholders agreement will be drafted. This
                                agreement has to
                                be signed by both parties and the agreement is binding as soon as the investment funds

                            <p>In our eyes, the perfect investor is someone who understands that nothing in business or
                                life is
                                perfect, they also
                                understand that the journey itself, is as important as the goal.<br><br>

                                Investors like these understand our family-oriented business values and the motivation
                                of the
                                people behind the company.<br><br>

                                To ensure our offering remains relevant, we continue developing and evolving our
                                concept,
                                sometimes through innovation,
                                other times through challenges, opportunities and adversity.<br><br>

                                Willems Ventures began as a project with private investors. We aim to onboard new
                                investors to our
                                business, but rather
                                than funds we are looking for people that can provide either their professional
                                expertise, market
                                connections, a dash of
                                humour and a personable mindset.
